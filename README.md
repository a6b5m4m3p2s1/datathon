# How to use this repo
Datathon data is stored in the "Data" folder. When you're writing code, make sure it points to this folder and try to make it platform-agnostic (eg. using os.path() instead of "//" or "\\" so it works on all machines)

Try not to save anything on the root drive so we can keep the repo clean; make a folder for anything you are adding to the repo, or add to folders that make sense.
