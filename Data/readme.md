# Melbourne Data Science Datathon: Satellite Intelligence

The task is to build an interactive App (e.g. browser based) which utilizes satellite data to provide
insight into the production of sugarcane over time. You may use any publicly available dataset
that you see fit, but it must incorporate the analysis of satellite imagery.

The task is deliberately open ended to provide you with the opportunity to think about the
different ways that this kind of data may help different kinds of people.

We encourage you to participate in this task in teams of up to 5 people, although you may also
participate as an individual.

# Getting Started

The demo script contains a number of simple methods to help get you started with the analysis of
imagery. The script shows how you can find the color of a pixel (in Red, Green, Blue, Alpha
format) as well as how to track whether a certain pixel is set in a mask. The demo script prints an
ascii version of the mask tile, with Xâ€™s for regions in the mask, and nothing for others.

## Python version

The demo uses Python 3.6.3 - newer versions should also work.

## Install packages

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the script

```
python demo.py
```
